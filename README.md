### **Leap Year Checker - Shitcode Edition** 🐛

#### **Idea**

This is a highly sophisticated leap year checker that determines whether a year is a leap year. 

#### **How to Compile/Interpret** 🖥️

1.  Open your favorite IDE (the one where you're fine with losing some brain cells) and paste the code into empty project.
2.  Ensure that your system supports C# and pray that your compiler has mercy on this code.
3.  Build the project, even though it'll probably look at you in confusion.
4.  Run it.
5.  Or you can ignore all of that stuff and just paste it here and hit 'run': [Online Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/csharp-programming/online-compiler/)
6.  Enter any year, preferably between 1800 and 2400 (or just mess with it and enter something wild).

#### **Why this code is glorious** 🌟

-   It completely ignores basic leap year logic and just brute-forces its way with an array that no one should be forced to look at.
-   The entire logic is compacted into one line because who needs readability when you have pure chaos?
-   No unnecessary comments, because the code speaks for itself (it screams, really).
